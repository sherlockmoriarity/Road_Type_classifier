# ROAD CONDITION/TYPE CLASSIFIER

Training Data

The training data for this project consists of images sourced from Google Images, representing various road conditions: snowy, icy, pothole, and wet. Due to the large size of the dataset, it cannot be uploaded directly to the GitHub repository.

To obtain the dataset, please follow these steps:

1)Download Images: Search for the specific road conditions on Google Images.
2)Organize Images: Create separate folders for each road type (e.g., snowy, icy, pothole, wet).
TIP: Use 'Download All Images' Chrome Extension for easy download.
3)Prepare for Training: Place the organized images in a directory structure compatible with the training script.
